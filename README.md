# integral-matching
 
`repeated_integral_matching.py` finds the polynomial of order `2n - 1` (with `2n` terms) whose `2n` repeated definite integrals across `[-RADIUS, RADIUS]` equal those of some function `f`. This is largely useless because Taylor polynomials and least-square fits perform better (best, in fact, by definition).
